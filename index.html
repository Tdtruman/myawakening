        <h3>Need to Talk Right Now?</h3>
        <p>Speaking with someone who understands can make a difference. You don’t have to go through this alone. Crisis counselors are available to help you navigate your feelings and find hope.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Start the Conversation:</strong></p>
        <p>When you connect with a crisis counselor, you can start by saying something like:</p>
        <ul style="text-align: left; color: #cbe7e6;">
            <li>"I'm feeling overwhelmed and I need someone to talk to."</li>
            <li>"I don't feel okay, and I don’t know what to do."</li>
            <li>"I'm struggling and I need help."</li>
            <li>"I feel alone and I just need to talk to someone who understands."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>You Matter. Your Feelings Matter.</h2>
        <p>We know that depression is overwhelming, painful, and isolating. But you are not alone. This moment will pass, and there are people who care about you. You deserve help, support, and healing. You are worthy of a future filled with hope.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why should you help yourself?</strong></p>
        <p>Because you deserve happiness, love, and a future full of possibilities. Because your pain is temporary, and healing is possible. Because even when things seem dark, there is light ahead. There are people who will listen, who will support you, and who want to see you thrive. You are not a burden. You are important.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Feeling Lonely Even With Friends?</strong></p>
        <p>It’s painful to feel invisible, especially when you have friends but they don’t reach out to you. You might wonder if they care or if you truly belong. The truth is, people often get caught up in their own lives and forget to check in, but that doesn’t mean they don’t care. It’s okay to take the first step—send a message, make plans, or express how you’re feeling. Real friendships thrive on communication. And if you’re feeling disconnected, there are people and communities out there who will reach back when you reach out. You are not alone.</p>
